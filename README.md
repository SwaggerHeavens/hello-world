# hello-world
Well this is my first repository so am not exactly sure what to say here.
So the instructions say I should write a bit about myself. Okay, am someone who's trying to learn as much as I can and as fast as I can. I want to do a lot of things beginning with starting my own social networking platform. So I need a website and later on an application for that. I am currently working on horning my web dev skills but if I could, I would want to have both the app and website done at the same time.
